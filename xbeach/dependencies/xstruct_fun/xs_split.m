%XS_SPLIT  Splits a XStruct in multiple XStructs
%
%   Splits a XStruct in multiple XStructs by moving
%   several fields to one XStruct and others to another. User '*'
%   to select all non-matched fields.
%
%   Syntax:
%   varargout = xs_split(xs, varargin)
%
%   Input:
%   xs        = XStruct array
%   varargin  = List of fields to be stored in one XStruct. To
%               store multiple fields in a XStruct, use a cell
%               array of field names as item in the list.
%
%   Output:
%   varargout = List of XStruct arrays.
%
%   Example
%   [xs1 xs2 xs3] = xs_split(xs, {'nx' 'ny'}, 'bcfile', {'xfile', 'yfile'})
