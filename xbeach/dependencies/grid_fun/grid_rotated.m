function [x y pind] = grid_rotated(xs, ys, alfa, m, n, dm, dn)
%GRID_ROTATED  Create a rotated structured grid for interpolation of scattered data.
%
%   Creates a structured grid under a user-specified rotation angle, which fits tightly around a scattered 2D dataset.
%
%   Syntax:
%   [x y pind] = grid_rotated(xs, ys, alfa, m, n)
%
%   Input: For <keyword,value> pairs call grid_rotated() without arguments.
%   xs   =  Vector of x-coordinates of scattered dataset
%   ys   =  Vector of y-coordinates of scattered dataset
%   alfa =  User-specified rotation angle of output grid (degrees clockwise)
%   m    =  Number of gridpoints in North-South direction (before rotation)
%           Set to zero if gridsize is used
%   n    =  Number of gridpoints in East-West direction (before rotation)
%           Set to zero if gridsize is used
%   dm   =  Gridsize in north-south direction (before rotation) in units of scatter data
%           Set to zero if number of gridpoints is used
%   dn   =  Gridsize in East-West direction (before rotation) in units of  scatter data 
%           Set to zero is number of gridpoints is used
% 
%   Number of gridpoints overrules gridsize !
%
% 
% %   Output:
%   x    =  Matrix of x-coordinates of rotated structured grid
%   y    =  Matrix of y-coordinates of rotated structured grid
%   pind =  Indices of gridpoints outside of the scattered data boundingbox
%
%   Example:
%   Start with scattered dataset, interpolate values zs given at
%   coordinates (xs,ys) to a rotated structured grid under an angle of 45
%   degrees, with finally 100 gridpoints from SW to NE and 50 gridpoints
%   from NW to SE. 'Interpolated' values that fall outside the bounding box
%   of the scattered dataset are set to nan.
%
%   [x,y,pind] = grid_rotated(xs,ys,45,100,50,0,0);
%   zint = scatteredInterpolant(xs,ys,zs);
%   z = zint(x,y);
%   z(~pind) = nan;
%
%   UPDATE: 
%   Option to use gridsize instead of number gridpoints
